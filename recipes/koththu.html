    <ol>
        <li>In a large wok or non-stick pan (12 inch), heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is heated, add the onion and saute until softened. Add the ginger and garlic and saute for a few seconds. Do not let them burn.</li>
        <li>Add all the vegetables (except for the carrots) and a generous pinch of salt and stir-fry for a few minutes. Add the chicken, cayenne pepper and the curry sauce and stir-fry until the vegetables are just starting to soften. If you don't have leftover curry sauce, then add the ingredients for the curry spices given in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and mix them in. Whisk the eggs together in a bowl, and season with a pinch of salt. Create a well in the middle of the vegetable mix and add the eggs into this well. Let the eggs cook while scrambling them. When the eggs are almost cooked, you can mix it with the vegetables and chicken. Taste and season with salt.</li>
        <li>If you're making chicken and cheese kottu roti, add the shredded cheese and mix through at this point.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded roti, and mix through with the vegetables and chicken. Mix frequently until the shredded roti is completely coated with the all the spices and curry sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
